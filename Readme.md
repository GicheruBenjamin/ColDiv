## Collapsible Div with Pure Html and Css.
Here u can see the use of + selector for sibling selection.
Also there is use of transition as a whole where all values are in one place.
Visibility and opacity changes to make things possible when the chech mark is checked.
Not forgetting the :checked pseudo class.
